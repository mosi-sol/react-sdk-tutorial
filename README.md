# Tribe Front-End Assessment

This code is the final version of Tribe's [React SDK Tutorial](https://partners.tribe.so/docs/guide/tutorials/react-sdk-tutorial/introduction)
with some modifications to work in [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io).

Your task is to add a feature. We want to have the ability to search, order, and filter the news
in the homepage. It's entirely up to you how you want to design and implement it.

### Hints
1. Append `/react-sdk-tutorial` to the url to see the homepage
2. The `feed` query has properties `orderBy` and `filterBy` that might be useful.
    You can try it in the [GraphQL Playground](https://app.tribe.so/api/gateway).
